This is a ready-to-use demonstration of real time notifications. We set a reminder in minutes for your timezone and get a notification at that the specified time directly in the web page. This demo uses slanger along with sidekiq to push realtime notifications

1. Install Mongodb 
2. Install redis server
3. Start Mongodb and Redis server.

Now, to start the demo, please follow steps below:
